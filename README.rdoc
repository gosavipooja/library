Use-cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case a room having reservations gets deleted, those members will still view the bookings in their history.
This is because as per the member, he/she had booked it.
None of the members who had reservations on the room get deleted.

When a library member gets deleted, the history of rooms which he/she had reserved remain intact. This is
because the history of a room should have all reservations done on a room.
